Welcome to Hermes2D!

This is a README file for Windows (using MinGW).

Download and install the free Dev-C++ IDE from http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/
It only has 9 MB and contains a user-friendly IDE and the complete GCC compiler
for Windows called MinGW. When prompted for the installation directory, use C:\Dev-Cpp

To ensure that important files such as the GCC compiler and the libraries can
always be found, right-click My Computer and go to Properties / Advanced / Environment Variables.
Press the New button and enter a variable called "Path" containing the text

C:\Dev-Cpp\bin;C:\Dev-Cpp\include;C:\Dev-Cpp\lib

Since the compilation of libraries that Hermes2D depends on is extremely painful
on Windows, we have prepared a pre-compiled package containing the libraries
FreeGLUT, Judy, pthread, BLAS and UMFPACK. All you have to do is download the
file hermes2d-win32-libs.zip and extract it into C:\Dev-Cpp. It is crucial that
the library files (*.a, *.dll) are extracted to the (already existing) directory
C:\Dev-Cpp\lib and the header files to C:\Dev-Cpp\include.

Now download and extract the Hermes2D source archive or check out the latest
version with SVN. Open the file hermes2d-real.dev, which is a Dev-C++ project
for the real version of Hermes2D and build the library by pressing Ctrl+F9.
Close the IDE and repeat for the complex version by opening hermes2d-cplx.dev

Each example in the examples/ directory has its own .dev file. Open one of them
with Dev-C++ and press F9 to compile and run the example.

Microsoft Visual Studio 9 2008 (Express Edition) is supported, see README-Win-MSVC2008.
